# Calculix

A fast-paced mental math speed challenge game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Calculix is a web-based game that tests your mental math skills. Solve arithmetic problems as quickly as possible to maximize your score.

I like math, science and coding a lot so i created this project where you can test how fast you can calculate in your mind and answer the questions. 

Building Calculix was a real learning experience for me, especially managing state across different game screens and implementing the timer system with proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks. 

The most challenging part was implementing the combo scoring system with real-time UI updates while managing asynchronous setTimeout calls and ensuring buttons were properly disabled during animations. I also struggled with creating plausible wrong answers that varied enough to be challenging but weren't too obviously incorrect, and learning to use the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to randomize the options efficiently. 

The CSS animations and backdrop filters for the glassmorphism effects taught me a lot about modern web design, and handling keyboard shortcuts alongside button clicks required understanding event bubbling and proper event listener management.


It was a quite much hectic and lot of time went in debugging and improving the project. I also enjoyed the math question like how fast i can do them. 


I am also feeling somewhat more confident in javascript with each project.
